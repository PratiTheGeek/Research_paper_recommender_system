The "Research Paper Recommender and Subject Area Predictor" project seeks to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the literature review process for students.
By leveraging advanced machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, this system takes as input a research paper's title and abstract, then identifies and recommends the top five most relevant research papers from a curated academic database.
